         "Neighbourhood and location:<br /><br />The über-cool Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood of Berlin is a hit with Berliner locals for its superb gastronomic offer and vintage shopping, Mauerpark's famed flea market, and brunch cafés. Countless restaurants, cafés and little shops create a unique atmosphere, unravelled in the rest of the city. <br /><br />Central,  yet quieter than Berlin Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg is also one of the prettiest neighbourhoods. Much of it escaped damage in the second world war and post-war redevelopment. <br /><br /><br />Public Transportation:<br />Excellent public transport connections take you to Mitte in just a few minutes, where you can visit main Berlin attractions, such as Alexanderplatz, Museum Island or Hackescher Markt. Nearby S-Bahn: Prenzlauer Allee S9 , Ringbahn , S8; Nearby U-Bahn: Schönhauser Allee (U2). The apartment, although apparently far on the map, is also well connected to the fair Berlin-Messe, which can be reached with line 42 in just 25 minut",

Simon Dach Strasse is a popular spot with students, artists, young families as well as young Berliners.<br /><br />The front of the apartment building has a liquor and convenience shop, a fantastic bakery, café and icecream shop. Nearby Boxhagener platz hosts the fantastic farmers market on  Saturday, and the famous flea market on the Sunday. Reveler Str flea market is at the end of the Street.

Come and stay in our charming homes oozing art, soul and creative vibes. Our homes are created with love, lots of hard work, and a passion of collecting and creating.  We search the world for items we love. As much as possible, we recycle building materials, and upcycle furniture.
